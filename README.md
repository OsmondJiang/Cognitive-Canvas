# Cognitive Canvas üß†‚ú®

> An MCP-powered cognitive workspace that enables AI agents to think, plan, and execute complex tasks with human-like organizational abilities.

## What is Cognitive Canvas?

Cognitive Canvas is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that transforms AI agents, LLMs, and Copilot-style systems into research-grade cognitive workspaces. It provides advanced cognitive tools for systematic reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and persistent memory management.

Think of it as giving AI agents a "research laboratory" - a complete workspace where they can organize complex thoughts, break down multi-step problems, visualize intricate relationships, maintain coherent reasoning across extended conversations, generate statistical evidence, and seamlessly switch between topics without losing context.

**Core Philosophy**: Transform any AI from a simple chat assistant into a sophisticated research agent capable of PhD-level systematic thinking, evidence-based conclusions, and persistent knowledge building.

## üöÄ What Can It Do?

### 1. **Task Management & Action Planning** (`todo_command`)
- Break down complex problems into actionable tasks with batch operations
- Track progress with status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked)
- Add, update, delete, and organize tasks efficiently
- List and retrieve specific tasks for project management

### 2. **Conversation Context Management** (`chat_fork`)
- Create conversation branches for handling interruptions and topic switches
- Pause current discussions and seamlessly switch to new topics
- Resume previous conversations with full context restoration
- Search and visualize conversation trees with bookmark functionality
- Support for nested drilling and parallel topic switching

### 3. **Dependency & Relationship Mapping** (`relationship_mapper`)
- Create visual diagrams of task dependencies and relationships
- Support for multiple diagram types: flowcharts, sequence diagrams, mindmaps, org charts, and trees
- Batch operations for adding nodes and edges efficiently
- Generate both structured relationship tables and readable text-based graphs
- Visualize system architecture and process flows

### 4. **Table Builder** (`table_builder`)
- Transform unstructured information into organized tables and lists
- Support for various template types: simple tables, task lists, checklists, numbered/bulleted lists, voting tables, progress tables
- Batch operations for adding and updating data efficiently
- Automatic metrics calculation (completion rates, voting distributions, progress tracking)
- JSON and Markdown export capabilities for structured presentation

### 5. **Statistical Evidence Tool** (`statistical_evidence_tool`)
- Automated statistical analysis to support evidence-based arguments and decision making
- Auto-detects appropriate statistical methods (t-tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis) based on data structure
- Supports paired comparisons, group comparisons, correlation analysis, and descriptive statistics
- Batch analysis capabilities for processing multiple statistical questions efficiently
- Generates comprehensive reports with statistical conclusions, effect sizes, and significance testing
- Multiple output formats: business summaries, academic reports, comprehensive analysis

## üéØ Transform Any AI into a Deep-Thinking Research Agent

Cognitive Canvas transforms ordinary Copilot/Agent/AI into sophisticated **research-agent** and **deep-thinking mode** capabilities, enabling systematic reasoning and persistent memory.

### Key Transformations

üß† **From Simple Chat ‚Üí Research Agent**
- **Before**: AI gives quick answers and forgets context
- **After**: AI builds knowledge systematically, maintains research state, and develops insights over time

üîç **From Linear Responses ‚Üí Deep-Thinking Mode**
- **Before**: AI provides immediate, surface-level responses  
- **After**: AI breaks down complex problems, maps dependencies, validates hypotheses with statistical evidence, and reasons through multi-step solutions

üìä **From Stateless ‚Üí Persistent Intelligence**
- **Before**: Each conversation starts from scratch
- **After**: AI accumulates knowledge, tracks progress, maintains statistical evidence, and builds upon previous work

üéØ **From Opinion-Based ‚Üí Evidence-Driven**
- **Before**: AI provides subjective recommendations and gut feelings
- **After**: AI generates statistical evidence, calculates significance levels, measures effect sizes, and provides data-backed conclusions

### Real-World Impact Examples

**Software Development**
```
Normal AI: "Here's how to build an API..."
Enhanced AI: Systematically plans project phases ‚Üí tracks implementation progress ‚Üí 
             manages dependencies ‚Üí maintains technical decisions context
```

**Research & Analysis** 
```
Normal AI: "Based on this paper..."
Enhanced AI: Organizes literature systematically ‚Üí builds concept maps ‚Üí 
             tracks hypothesis development ‚Üí validates with statistical evidence ‚Üí 
             synthesizes findings with confidence intervals
```

**Business Planning**
```
Normal AI: "You should consider these factors..."
Enhanced AI: Breaks down strategic goals ‚Üí maps resource dependencies ‚Üí 
             tracks milestone progress ‚Üí validates decisions with A/B test analysis ‚Üí 
             maintains decision rationale with statistical backing
```

**Data-Driven Decision Making**
```
Normal AI: "The data suggests..."
Enhanced AI: Automatically detects analysis type ‚Üí performs appropriate statistical tests ‚Üí 
             calculates effect sizes and significance ‚Üí generates evidence-based conclusions ‚Üí 
             provides actionable insights with confidence levels
```

**Learning & Education**
```
Normal AI: "This concept means..."
Enhanced AI: Structures learning progression ‚Üí tracks mastery ‚Üí 
             maps prerequisite relationships ‚Üí adapts difficulty systematically
```

### The Core Difference

**Without Cognitive Canvas**: AI = Smart autocomplete with no memory, systematic thinking, or evidence validation
**With Cognitive Canvas**: AI = Research assistant with structured reasoning, persistent memory, statistical validation, and evidence-based conclusions

**Result**: Any AI system becomes capable of PhD-level systematic thinking, research methodology, and data-driven analysis with statistical rigor.

## üõ† How to Use It

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- MCP-compatible AI system (like Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, etc.)
