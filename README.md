# Cognitive-Canvas
An MCP-powered workspace that helps AI organize ideas, map dependencies, manage tasks, and maintain context, enabling smarter reasoning and execution.

A set of MCP services/tools designed to help AI agents, LLMs, or Copilot-style systems think, plan, and execute more effectively, using tools originally designed for humans. These tools will allow agents to organize ideas, structure conversations, and manage tasks systematically. Some examples include:

Action Management (TODO List Tool) – Helps the agent break down its ideas and answers into actionable items, track progress, and ensure all tasks are completed without duplication or omission. The agent can follow, update, and manage these tasks throughout a conversation to help users solve problems effectively.

Dependency Mapping (Diagram Tool) – Enables the agent to organize ideas and tasks into clear dependency diagrams. By visualizing sub-ideas and sub-task relationships, the agent can better plan execution, provide structured explanations, and ensure tasks are completed in the correct order. The agent can create, update, and retrieve diagrams to maintain a coherent reasoning process.

Structured Knowledge (Loop-like Tool) – Transforms plain text into structured data, such as tables or matrices. This tool helps the agent keep conversations well-organized, focusing on important content and maintaining clarity while planning or executing complex solutions.

Context Management (Fork Chat Tool) – Allows the agent to snapshot and fork stages of a conversation. When the user introduces unrelated questions or interruptions, the agent can temporarily switch context, resolve the new query, and then restore the original conversation state to continue seamlessly.

Together, these tools create a cognitive workspace for AI agents, enabling them to think, plan, and act more like humans while keeping interactions structured, coherent, and actionable.
